If your A-Level results weren't quite what you expected, UCAS Clearing offers a valuable opportunity to still secure a university place. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about the Clearing process and how to make the most of it.

## What is UCAS Clearing?

Clearing is the process through which universities fill any remaining places on their courses after the main application cycle. It runs from July to October each year, with the busiest period being [A-Level results day](/a-level-results-day/) and the days immediately following.

### Who Can Use Clearing?

You can use Clearing if you:
- Didn't receive any offers from universities
- Didn't meet the conditions of your offers
- Declined all your offers
- Applied after 30 June
- Paid the UCAS application fee and added a Clearing choice

## Key Dates for Clearing 2026

- **5 July 2026**: Clearing opens
- **13 August 2026**: A-Level results day - Clearing becomes most active
- **20 October 2026**: Deadline for Clearing applications

## How Does Clearing Work?

### Step 1: Check Your Status

Log into UCAS Hub on results day to see if you're in Clearing. If you are, you'll see a Clearing number - keep this handy as universities will ask for it.

### Step 2: Research Available Courses

Use the UCAS search tool to find courses with vacancies. Don't just focus on your original choices - consider:
- Similar courses at different universities
- Related subjects that interest you
- Universities in different locations

### Step 3: Contact Universities Directly

This is crucial - don't wait for universities to contact you. Be proactive:
- Call admissions departments directly
- Have your Clearing number and results ready
- Be prepared to explain why you want the course
- Ask about accommodation availability

### Step 4: Accept Your Offer

Once a university offers you a place verbally, add them as your Clearing choice in UCAS Hub. They'll then confirm the offer formally.

## Tips for Clearing Success

### Be Prepared

Before results day:
- Research backup courses and universities
- Have a list of phone numbers ready
- Prepare notes about why you want each course
- Know your GCSE grades too

### Act Quickly

Popular courses fill fast. On results day:
- Start calling universities early (lines open around 8am)
- Have someone help you research while you're on the phone
- Don't be discouraged by engaged lines - keep trying

### Stay Flexible

Consider:
- Foundation years that lead to your desired degree
- Joint honours courses combining your interests
- Universities you hadn't previously considered
- Courses that accept slightly lower grades

### Don't Panic

Clearing can be stressful, but remember:
- Thousands of students find places through Clearing every year
- Many excellent courses still have vacancies
- It's better to take your time than rush into the wrong course

## Alternatives to Clearing

If Clearing doesn't feel right for you, consider these options:

### Retaking A-Levels

If you narrowly missed your grades, [retaking your A-Levels](/a-level-retakes/) could help you achieve the results you need for your first-choice university. Many students improve by at least one grade with focused preparation.

### Gap Year

A gap year gives you time to:
- Retake exams if needed
- Gain work experience
- Travel and develop personally
- Reapply with a stronger application

### Apprenticeships

Higher and degree apprenticeships offer an alternative route, combining work experience with study. Many leading companies offer competitive programmes.

## What If Clearing Doesn't Work?

Don't despair if you don't find a suitable course through Clearing. You have several options:

1. **Take a gap year** and reapply next year with your actual grades
2. **[Retake your A-Levels](/a-level-retakes/)** to improve your results
3. **Consider alternative qualifications** like Access courses
4. **Explore other pathways** such as apprenticeships or employment

## Making the Right Decision

The most important thing is finding the right course and university for you - not just any place. Ask yourself:

- Am I genuinely interested in this subject?
- Does this university have good facilities and support?
- Can I see myself living there for 3+ years?
- What are the career prospects for graduates?
