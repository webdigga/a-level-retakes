If you didn't get the A-Level grades you needed, retaking privately is a flexible and increasingly popular option. Whether you left school, are working, or simply prefer to study independently, you can resit your A-Levels as a private candidate without being enrolled at a school or college.

This guide covers everything you need to know about the process, from registration to results day.

## What Is a Private A-Level Candidate?

A private candidate (also called an external candidate) is someone who sits an exam without being enrolled at a school or college. You register directly with an exam centre and study independently, through [private tuition](/private-tuition/), or via an online course.

Private candidates sit exactly the same exams and receive exactly the same qualifications as school-based students. Universities and employers make no distinction between privately obtained and school-obtained A-Levels.

## Who Can Retake A-Levels Privately?

Almost anyone can retake A-Levels as a private candidate. Common reasons include:

| Candidate Type | Typical Situation |
|---------------|------------------|
| School leavers | Didn't achieve grades needed for university |
| Mature students | Returning to education after time away |
| Home-educated students | Studied outside the traditional school system |
| Working professionals | Need A-Levels for a career change or further study |
| International students | Based in the UK and want to improve grades |

There is no upper age limit for retaking A-Levels, and you do not need to have sat the exam before to register as a private candidate.

## When Can You Retake A-Levels Privately?

There are two main exam series each year:

| | May/June Series | October/November Series |
|---|----------------|------------------------|
| **Subject availability** | All subjects | Limited subjects only |
| **Registration opens** | September - October | Summer (June - July) |
| **Standard entry deadline** | February | September |
| **Late entry deadline** | April | October |
| **Results released** | August (Results Day) | January |
| **Best for** | Full preparation over an academic year | Quick retake after August results |

**Important**: Not all subjects are available in the October/November series. Check with your exam board to confirm availability before planning your retake.

## How to Register as a Private Candidate

### Step 1: Choose Your Exam Board

The main exam boards offering A-Levels in England are:

| Exam Board | Key Strengths | Website |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **AQA** | Largest board in England, widest subject range | aqa.org.uk |
| **Pearson Edexcel** | Widely used, strong international recognition | qualifications.pearson.com |
| **OCR** | Popular for sciences and mathematics | ocr.org.uk |
| **WJEC/Eduqas** | Welsh board, also available in England | eduqas.co.uk |

If you are retaking, it is generally best to use the same exam board and specification you studied originally. This means your existing notes and revision materials will still be relevant, and you won't need to learn new content or adjust to a different exam format.

### Step 2: Find an Exam Centre

As a private candidate, you need to find an approved exam centre that accepts external entries. Options include:

- **Private exam centres** that specialise in external candidates
- **Schools and colleges** that accept private entries (not all do)
- **Specialist retake colleges** such as those in London that cater specifically to private candidates

When choosing a centre, check:
- They are approved by your chosen exam board
- They offer the specific subject and specification you need
- Their fees and what is included (invigilation, results forwarding, etc.)
- Their location and accessibility on exam days

### Step 3: Register Before the Deadline

Registration deadlines vary by exam board, but as a general guide for the May/June 2026 series:

| Exam Board | Standard Entry Deadline | Late Entry Deadline | Late Fee Surcharge |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| AQA | Late February 2026 | Mid-April 2026 | Yes |
| Edexcel | Late February 2026 | Mid-April 2026 | Yes |
| OCR | Late February 2026 | Mid-April 2026 | Yes |
| WJEC | Late February 2026 | Mid-April 2026 | Yes |

Late entries incur additional fees, so register as early as possible. Your exam centre will handle the registration process with the exam board on your behalf.

### Step 4: Pay Your Fees

As a private candidate, you will need to pay exam entry fees, centre administration fees, and potentially late entry surcharges.

## Costs of Retaking A-Levels Privately

The total cost depends on your approach to preparation:

| Component | Typical Cost | Notes |

| Exam centre admin fee (per subject) | £50 - £200 | Covers invigilation and facilities |
| Late entry surcharge (per subject) | £30 - £60 | Only if you miss standard deadline |

| Retake course (per subject) | £1,000 - £5,000+ | Intensive or part-time programmes |
| Revision materials | £20 - £100 | Textbooks, past papers, guides |

### Total Cost Comparison by Study Route

| Study Route | Estimated Total (per subject) | Best For |
|------------|------------------------------|----------|

## How to Prepare for Your Retake

### Identify What Went Wrong

Before diving into revision, reflect on why you didn't achieve your target grade the first time:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Struggled with specific topics | Target those topics with focused revision or tuition |
| Poor revision technique | Adopt [proven revision methods](/resources/10-proven-revision-techniques/) |
| Time management in exams | Practise with timed past papers |
| Exam anxiety or stress | Develop [anxiety management strategies](/resources/managing-exam-anxiety/) |
| External factors (illness, personal issues) | Ensure better support systems are in place |
| Gaps in foundational knowledge | Consider a structured course for comprehensive coverage |

### Study Options for Private Candidates

**Independent study**
The most affordable option. Use textbooks, online resources, and past papers to prepare. Best suited to motivated self-starters who performed close to their target grade.

**[Private tuition](/private-tuition/)**
One-to-one lessons with a specialist tutor. Ideal if you need targeted support in specific areas or prefer structured guidance. Tutors can identify gaps in your knowledge and tailor sessions to your needs.

**Retake courses**
Intensive or part-time [courses](/a-level-courses/) designed specifically for retake students. These offer structured teaching, regular assessments, and exam practice. Available in-person at specialist colleges or online.

**Online learning**
Flexible option that combines video lessons, interactive exercises, and tutor support. Useful if you are working alongside your studies or cannot attend in-person classes.

### Use Past Papers Extensively

Past papers are the single most effective revision tool for A-Level retakes. They help you:

- Understand the exam format and mark scheme
- Identify recurring question patterns
- Practise writing under timed conditions
- Build confidence for exam day

Aim to complete at least five full past papers under timed conditions before your exam. Mark them using the official mark schemes to identify areas for improvement.

## Private Retake Success Rates

Retake students who invest in proper preparation consistently achieve strong results:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Students achieving A*-B on retake | 80% |
| Students achieving A*-A on retake | 43% |
| Retake students accepted at Russell Group universities | 77% |
| Average grade improvement with tuition support | 1.6 grades |

These figures demonstrate that with the right approach, retaking privately can lead to a significant improvement in your results and open doors to your first-choice university.

## Do Universities Accept Private A-Level Retakes?

Yes. Universities treat privately obtained A-Level grades the same as any other. Your certificate will show your grade with no indication of whether you were a private or school-based candidate.

Key points about university applications with retakes:

- Most universities accept retake grades, including Russell Group institutions
- [77% of retake students](/a-level-retakes/) secure places at Russell Group universities
- Some competitive courses (medicine, dentistry, veterinary science) may have specific retake policies, so check individual university requirements

## Common Questions About Retaking Privately

### Can I retake just one A-Level subject?
Yes. You can retake one, two, or all three of your A-Levels. Many students focus on the one or two subjects where improvement will make the biggest difference to their university application.

### Can I retake A-Levels at any age?
Yes. There is no age limit for sitting A-Level exams. Private candidates range from 17-year-olds to mature adults.

### Do I need to retake the full A-Level or just certain papers?
With linear A-Levels (the current system in England), you must retake all papers for a subject. You cannot carry over marks from individual papers.

### Can I change exam board for my retake?
Yes, but be cautious. Different boards have different specifications, so changing board means learning new content. Stick with your original board if possible.

### How long should I study before retaking?
This depends on your starting point. If you narrowly missed your target grade, a few months of focused preparation may be sufficient. If you need a significant improvement, a full academic year of study is recommended.

### Will my original grade still show on my record?
Universities will typically see all attempts through UCAS. However, your improved grade is what matters for meeting offer conditions, and retaking is viewed positively as it demonstrates resilience.
