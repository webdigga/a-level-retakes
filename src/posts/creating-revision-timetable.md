A well-structured revision timetable is one of the most powerful tools for A-Level success. It helps you cover all your material, reduces stress, and ensures you're making the most of your study time. Here's how to create a timetable that actually works.

## Why You Need a Revision Timetable

Without a plan, it's easy to:
- Spend too much time on favourite subjects
- Neglect difficult topics until it's too late
- Feel overwhelmed by the amount to cover
- Lose track of what you've studied

A good timetable addresses all these issues and gives you a clear path to follow.

## Step 1: Audit Your Time

Before creating your timetable, understand how much time you actually have.

### Calculate Available Time

Work out how many weeks until your exams, then:
- Subtract time for school/college
- Account for other commitments
- Factor in realistic study capacity

### Be Honest About Your Limits

Most people can only study effectively for 4-6 hours per day. Don't create a timetable that's impossible to stick to.

## Step 2: List Everything You Need to Cover

For each subject, create a comprehensive list:
- All topics in the specification
- Key concepts and theories
- Required practicals or coursework
- Past paper practice needed

### Prioritise Topics

Rank topics by:
1. **High priority**: Weak areas, heavily weighted topics
2. **Medium priority**: Average understanding, moderate weighting
3. **Lower priority**: Strong areas, lower weighting

## Step 3: Structure Your Timetable

### Choose Your Format

Options include:
- Paper planners or wall charts
- Digital calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Apps like Notion, Trello, or dedicated study apps
- Simple spreadsheets

The best format is one you'll actually use.

### Block Out Fixed Commitments

Start by adding:
- School or college hours
- Work commitments
- Regular activities you won't skip
- Meal times and sleep

### Allocate Subject Blocks

Divide remaining time between subjects. Consider:

**Subject weighting**: Give more time to subjects with more content or where you're weaker.

**Time of day**: Schedule difficult subjects when you're most alert (usually mornings for most people).

**Subject mixing**: Don't study similar subjects back-to-back - your brain benefits from variety.

## Step 4: Plan Each Study Block

A good study block includes:

### Clear Objectives
Instead of "Study Chemistry", try "Complete ionic bonding topic and practice 3 past paper questions".

### Active Learning
Include specific activities:
- Create flashcards for key terms
- Complete practice questions
- Summarise a chapter
- Teach a concept to someone

### Timed Sessions
Use the [Pomodoro Technique](/resources/10-proven-revision-techniques/):
- 25 minutes focused study
- 5 minutes break
- Repeat 4 times
- Take a longer 15-30 minute break

## Step 5: Schedule Breaks and Rest

### Daily Breaks
Include:
- Short breaks between study sessions (5-10 minutes)
- Proper lunch break (at least 30 minutes)
- Evening free time for relaxation

### Weekly Rest
Schedule at least one full day off per week. Your brain needs time to consolidate learning.

### The Importance of Sleep
Never sacrifice sleep for revision. Aim for 8-9 hours per night - sleep is when your brain processes and stores what you've learned.

## Sample Timetable Structure

Here's an example for a student with three A-Level subjects:

| Time | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 9-10:30 | Biology | Chemistry | Physics | Biology | Chemistry | Physics | REST |
| 10:30-11 | Break | Break | Break | Break | Break | Break | DAY |
| 11-12:30 | Chemistry | Physics | Biology | Chemistry | Physics | Biology | |
| 12:30-1:30 | Lunch | Lunch | Lunch | Lunch | Lunch | Lunch | |
| 2-3:30 | Physics | Biology | Chemistry | Physics | Biology | Past Papers | |
| 3:30-4 | Break | Break | Break | Break | Break | Break | |
| 4-5 | Review/Catch-up | Review/Catch-up | Review/Catch-up | Review/Catch-up | Review/Catch-up | Free | |
| Evening | Free | Free | Free | Free | Free | Free | |

## Tips for Sticking to Your Timetable

### Be Flexible
Life happens. If you miss a session, don't stress - just adjust and continue.

### Review Weekly
At the end of each week:
- What worked well?
- What didn't get done?
- What needs more time next week?

### Reward Progress
Build in small rewards for hitting milestones:
- Completed a topic? Watch an episode of your favourite show
- Finished a past paper? Have a treat
- Stuck to your timetable all week? Do something fun at the weekend

### Find an Accountability Partner
Study with a friend or family member who can help keep you on track.

### Track Your Progress
Use a visual tracker to see how much you've covered. Crossing off completed topics feels satisfying and motivating.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Being Too Ambitious
A timetable that's too demanding will lead to burnout and frustration. Start conservative and add more if needed.

### Ignoring Weak Areas
It's tempting to spend time on subjects you enjoy. Make sure weak areas get attention.

### No Flexibility
Leave buffer time for catching up or deeper dives into tricky topics.

### Forgetting Practice Questions
Active practice is essential. Schedule regular past paper time, not just reading.

### Starting Too Late
Begin your timetable early. Last-minute cramming is stressful and less effective than [spaced repetition](/resources/10-proven-revision-techniques/).

## Adjusting Your Timetable

Your timetable should evolve as exams approach:

**8+ weeks before**: Focus on understanding and notes
**4-8 weeks before**: Mix understanding with practice questions
**2-4 weeks before**: Heavy focus on past papers
**Final 2 weeks**: Past papers, review, and consolidation
