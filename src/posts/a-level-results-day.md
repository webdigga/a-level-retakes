A-Level results day is a significant milestone for students across the UK. Here's everything you need to know about what to expect and how to prepare.

## When is A-Level Results Day?

A-Level results day typically falls on the third Thursday of August each year. Results are released at 8am and cannot be accessed prior to this time.

## How to Receive Your Results

Most schools and colleges will email results to students on the morning. However, you may also have the option to:
- Collect a paper copy in person
- Request a phone call from your school or college

Contact your school or college's exams officer if you have specific requests about how you'd like to receive your results.

## What If You Don't Get the Grades You Expected?

If you feel you've narrowly missed your target grades or suspect errors in marking, you can access post-results services offered by exam boards. These include:
- Requesting a priority copy of your marked paper
- Opting for a review of marking

Your school or college's exams officer can guide you through the process and deadlines.

## Appeals Process

If you're dissatisfied with the outcome of a review of marking, you can appeal the decision with the exam board. Appeals must be submitted through your school or college, so communicate promptly with your exams officer if you believe an appeal is necessary.

## UCAS and University Places

UCAS Track opens at 8am on results day, allowing you to check the status of your university applications. It's essential to:
- Carefully review your application status
- Contact your chosen university if you have questions
- Explore Clearing options if necessary
