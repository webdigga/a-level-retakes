At Westminster Tutors, their foremost aim is to support each of their sixth form students in achieving their highest academic potential. This commitment is reflected in the outstanding A-level results achieved by their students, with an impressive average of 65% achieving A\*-A grades and 87% achieving A\*-B grades.

On A-level results day, which this year falls on Thursday, August 15, 2024, their priority is to guide our students through the process and assist them in making informed decisions based on their results. Here's what you can expect:

**Timing of A-level Results Release:**

Results will be available to students promptly at 8 am. Please note that results cannot be accessed prior to this time, so we kindly request that students refrain from attempting to inquire earlier.

**How to Receive Results:**

They will email all our sixth form students their statements of results. However, students have the option to request a phone call instead or collect a paper copy of their results in person from our college premises. For any specific requests regarding the delivery of results, please contact Jason, the Exams Officer.

**Post-Results Services:**

If students feel they have narrowly missed their target grades or suspect errors in marking, they may avail of post-results services offered by exam boards. These services include requesting a priority copy of a marked paper or opting for a review of marking. The Exams Officer, Jason, can provide guidance on the process and deadlines for such requests.

**Appeals Process:**

In the event of dissatisfaction with the outcome of a review of marking, students have the option to appeal the decision with the exam board. Their college is responsible for submitting appeals on behalf of all their students, and encourage prompt communication with the Exams Officer should an appeal be necessary.

**UCAS Application and Clearing:**

UCAS Track, where students can check the status of their university applications, will also open at 8 am on August 17, 2023. It's essential to carefully review application statuses and explore options available through Clearing if necessary. Our Director of Studies, Virginia, is available to provide guidance and support throughout this process.

At Westminster Tutors, they understand the significance of A-level results day and are dedicated to providing their students with the assistance and encouragement they need to navigate this pivotal moment in their academic journey. They encourage students to reach out to us for any assistance or advice they may require, and they are there to ensure a smooth and successful transition to the next phase of their education.
