There are a wide variety of A level courses and A Level Retakes courses offered at Westminster Tutors Sixth Form College. They can teach all exam boards and any combination of subjects is possible, as their courses are individually designed and taught either one-to-one or in very small groups. A typical A level student would study three subjects over the course of two years, although they often admit ambitious students who would like to take a fourth A level subject or an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) in Year 12.
