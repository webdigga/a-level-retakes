Congratulations to everyone who completed their A-Level exams! As you enjoy a well-deserved summer break, here's some essential information about what to expect on A-Level Results Day and the options available to you depending on your results.

## What Day & Time Are A-Level Results Released?

A-Level results are typically released at 8am on the third Thursday of August. Results cannot be obtained before this time.

## How Will You Receive Your Results?

Your school or college will have their own arrangements for distributing results. Common options include:

- **Email**: Results sent directly to your inbox
- **Phone Call**: You can request a phone call to receive your results
- **In-Person**: Collect a paper copy from your school or college

Contact your exams officer to confirm how you'll receive yours.

## Can You Request a Remark of Your A-Level Results?

If you believe your exam was not marked correctly or you narrowly missed your target grade, you can request a post-results service:

- **Priority Copy of Marked Paper**: Available to help you decide whether to request a remark
- **Review of Marking**: Keep in mind that the grade may go up, down, or stay the same

Check with your school or college for current deadlines, as these vary by exam board and year.

## A-Level Retakes

If your results were not as expected and you're considering retaking your A-Levels, specialist retake colleges offer tailored courses designed to help students improve their grades. Many students see significant improvements, with top providers achieving 80% A*-B grades and 77% of students going on to Russell Group universities.

The next A-Level retake opportunity is typically in June of the following year, though some exam boards offer November sittings for certain subjects.
