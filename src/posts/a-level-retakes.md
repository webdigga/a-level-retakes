In the UK, students have the opportunity to retake their A-level exams during the next available examination series after the original exams. Typically, there are two main examination series for A-levels: May/June and October/November. For students seeking to improve their grades or meet subject requirements for further education or university applications, the October/November series offers a chance to retake exams.

Individuals interested in A-level retakes should verify specific dates and registration deadlines with exam boards or educational institutions, as they may vary annually.
