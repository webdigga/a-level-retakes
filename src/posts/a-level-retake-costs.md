Retaking your A-Levels is one of the best investments you can make in your future, but the costs are not always obvious upfront. Between exam board fees, centre charges, study materials, and potentially tuition, the total bill depends on the route you choose and the support you need.

This guide breaks down every cost you are likely to encounter when retaking A-Levels in 2026, along with practical ways to reduce the bill and funding options that many students overlook.

## How Much Does It Cost to Retake A-Levels?

The short answer is anywhere from around £150 per subject (independent study, exam only) to £5,000 or more per subject (full-time retake college). The table below gives a quick overview before we break each cost down in detail.

| Route | Estimated Total Per Subject | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Self-study + exam only | £150 - £450 | Students close to their target grade who need minimal support |
| Self-study + private tuition | £500 - £1,500 | Students who need help in specific weak areas |
| Part-time retake course | £1,500 - £3,000 | Students wanting structure alongside other commitments |
| Full-time retake college | £3,000 - £5,500+ | Students needing significant grade improvement or a complete retake year |

## Exam Board Fees

Every A-Level retake requires paying an entry fee to the exam board. This is the non-negotiable cost that everyone pays regardless of how they study.

The four main exam boards in England each set their own fees, and these change annually. For the 2025/26 academic year (summer 2026 exams), fees vary by subject and by board, but typical A-Level entry fees fall in the range below.

| Exam Board | Typical A-Level Entry Fee | Where to Check Exact Fees |
|---|---|---|
| AQA | £50 - £120 per subject | [aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/entries/entry-fees](https://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/entries/entry-fees) |
| Pearson Edexcel | £50 - £120 per subject | [qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/centre-administration/fees](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/centre-administration/fees.html) |
| OCR | £50 - £120 per subject | [ocr.org.uk/administration/fees](https://www.ocr.org.uk/administration/fees/) |
| WJEC/Eduqas | £50 - £120 per subject | [eduqas.co.uk](https://www.eduqas.co.uk/) |

Fees vary by subject because some subjects have more exam papers than others. A three-paper subject costs more than a two-paper subject. Science subjects with practical endorsements may also carry additional charges.

**Important:** These are the fees charged to exam centres, not directly to you. If you are retaking through a school or college, the exam board fee is usually included in their overall charge. If you are a [private candidate](/resources/how-to-retake-a-levels-privately/), your exam centre pays the board and passes the cost on to you, sometimes with a markup.

### Late Entry Fees

Missing the standard entry deadline (typically late February for the summer series) means paying a late entry surcharge on top of the base fee. Late fees escalate the longer you wait:

| Deadline Stage | Typical Surcharge |
|---|---|
| Standard deadline (late February) | No surcharge |
| Late entry window (March) | £30 - £60 per subject |
| Very late entry (April) | £60 - £120 per subject |
| Final deadline (late April) | Up to £200+ per subject |

Registering on time is one of the simplest ways to avoid unnecessary costs. Check the [key dates for 2026](/resources/a-level-key-dates-2026/) to stay ahead of deadlines.

## Exam Centre Fees (Private Candidates)

If you are retaking as a private candidate rather than through a school or college, you will need to book a place at an approved exam centre. Centres charge an administration fee on top of the exam board entry fee to cover invigilation, room hire, and paperwork.

Centre fees vary significantly depending on the provider:

| Centre Type | Typical Fee Per Subject | What Is Included |
|---|---|---|
| School or college accepting external candidates | £50 - £150 | Basic invigilation and results forwarding |
| Specialist private exam centre | £200 - £400 | Invigilation, results, certificate handling, sometimes mock exams |
| Premium London centres | £350 - £500+ | Full service including registration, invigilation, and support |

Some centres quote an all-inclusive price that bundles the exam board fee and their own admin fee together. Others quote their admin fee separately. Always ask what is included before comparing prices.

When choosing a centre, cheaper is not always better. Check that the centre is approved by your exam board, offers your specific subject and specification, and has a track record with private candidates. Our guide on [retaking A-Levels privately](/resources/how-to-retake-a-levels-privately/) covers how to find and evaluate centres.

## Tuition and Course Costs

Exam fees are just the entry ticket. The bigger variable is how you prepare, and this is where costs can range from zero to several thousand pounds.

### Independent Study (Free to £100)

Studying on your own is the most affordable option. Exam board websites publish past papers, mark schemes, and examiner reports for free. If you scored close to your target grade and know where you went wrong, self-study with these resources may be all you need.

The main costs are revision guides and textbooks, typically £15 to £30 each. If you kept your originals from your first time through, even this cost disappears.

### Private Tuition (£40 to £80 Per Hour)

[Private tuition](/private-tuition/) is the middle ground between fully independent study and a structured course. A specialist A-Level tutor can identify your weak areas, explain difficult concepts, and coach your exam technique.

Most students working with a tutor have weekly sessions over several months. At one hour per week for 20 weeks at £50 per hour, that is approximately £1,000 per subject. Some students need fewer sessions, particularly if they are strong in most areas and just need targeted help on specific topics.

### Online Courses (£350 to £800 Per Subject)

Online retake courses offer structured learning with video lessons, assignments, and tutor support at a lower cost than in-person options. They are flexible enough to fit around work or other commitments.

Prices typically include access to the course materials, tutor support, and sometimes mock exams. Exam entry fees are usually separate.

### Retake Colleges (£1,500 to £5,500+ Per Subject)

Specialist retake colleges offer the most comprehensive support: structured timetables, small class sizes, regular assessments, and dedicated pastoral care. [80% of retake students at specialist colleges achieve A* to B grades](/a-level-retakes/), making them a strong option for students who need significant improvement.

Intensive one-term courses (January to June) tend to cost less than full-year programmes. Some colleges offer part-time options at a reduced rate.

## Revision Materials

Beyond tuition, there are smaller costs that add up:

| Item | Typical Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Revision guide (per subject) | £8 - £15 | CGP, Hodder, Pearson |
| Textbook (per subject) | £20 - £35 | Only needed if you no longer have yours |
| Past paper booklet | £5 - £10 | Free to download from exam board websites |
| Stationery and printing | £10 - £20 | For printing past papers and notes |
| Online revision platform (e.g. Save My Exams, Physics and Maths Tutor) | £0 - £50 | Many resources are free; premium tiers available |

**Tip:** Before buying anything, check whether your local library stocks revision guides. Many libraries now carry current editions of popular A-Level revision books.

## Total Cost Examples

To make this concrete, here are three realistic scenarios for a student retaking two A-Level subjects:

### Scenario 1: Budget Self-Study Route

| Cost | Amount |
|---|---|
| Exam board fees (2 subjects) | £200 |
| Exam centre fees (2 subjects, private candidate) | £300 |
| Revision guides (2 subjects) | £30 |
| Past papers and printing | £15 |
| **Total** | **£545** |

### Scenario 2: Self-Study With Tuition

| Cost | Amount |
|---|---|
| Exam board fees (2 subjects) | £200 |
| Exam centre fees (2 subjects) | £300 |
| Private tutor, 15 hours per subject at £50/hr | £1,500 |
| Revision materials | £50 |
| **Total** | **£2,050** |

### Scenario 3: Retake College

| Cost | Amount |
|---|---|
| College fees including exam entry (2 subjects) | £6,000 - £10,000 |
| Travel costs (monthly travel card, 6 months) | £600 |
| Revision materials | £50 |
| **Total** | **£6,650 - £10,650** |

## Funding Options and Financial Support

The cost of retaking A-Levels can be a barrier for many families, but there are several sources of financial help.

### 16 to 19 Bursary Fund

If you are aged 16 to 18 and enrolled at a school or college, you may be eligible for the [16 to 19 Bursary Fund](https://www.gov.uk/1619-bursary-fund). This government scheme helps with essential education costs including transport, books, equipment, and in some cases exam fees.

There are two types of bursary:

| Type | Amount | Eligibility |
|---|---|---|
| Vulnerable bursary | Up to £1,200 per year | Students in care, care leavers, students receiving Universal Credit or disability benefits |
| Discretionary bursary | Varies by institution | Students facing financial hardship (assessed by school or college) |

Apply directly through your school or college. Each institution sets its own criteria for the discretionary bursary.

### Advanced Learner Loan

If you are aged 19 or over, you may be eligible for a government [Advanced Learner Loan](https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan) to cover course fees at an approved provider. These loans work similarly to university student loans: you only start repaying once your income exceeds the threshold, and any remaining balance is written off after a set period.

### Exam Board Fee Waivers

Some exam boards offer reduced fees or waivers for students in financial hardship, particularly through schools and colleges. Ask your exam centre whether any fee reductions are available.

### Retake College Bursaries

Several specialist retake colleges offer their own bursaries or scholarships for students with strong academic potential who face financial barriers. These are competitive but worth exploring. Contact colleges directly to ask about financial support.

### Payment Plans

Many private tuition providers and retake colleges offer payment plans that spread the cost over several months. Some offer interest-free instalments, making larger investments more manageable.

## How to Save Money on A-Level Retakes

### Retake Through Your Current School or College

If you are still of school age, your school or sixth form may allow you to retake at no additional cost or for just the exam board fee. This is by far the cheapest option and worth exploring first.

### Register on Time

As outlined above, late entry fees can add hundreds of pounds to your total bill. Set calendar reminders for entry deadlines and register as early as possible.

### Use Free Resources

Exam board websites offer past papers, mark schemes, and examiner reports at no charge. YouTube channels like Physics and Maths Tutor, Cognito, and Science Shorts provide high-quality free video lessons for many A-Level subjects.

### Buy Second-Hand Textbooks

Revision guides and textbooks are frequently sold by students who have finished their exams. Check student forums, local selling groups, and second-hand book websites. Ensure the edition matches your current specification before purchasing.

### Focus Your Spending

If budget is tight, invest in tuition for your weakest subject only and self-study the others. Targeted spending on the areas with the most room for improvement gives the best return.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to retake one A-Level?

The minimum cost is around £100 to £200 if you retake through your existing school and only pay the exam board fee. As a private candidate with self-study, expect £200 to £400 including centre fees. With tuition or a retake course, costs range from £500 to over £5,000 per subject depending on the level of support.

### Do I have to pay to retake A-Levels at school?

It depends on your school or college. Some cover the exam board fee for retake students, particularly if you are under 19. Others charge the fee to the student. Ask your exams officer for your school's policy.

### Are A-Level retake costs tax-deductible?

No. A-Level exam fees and tuition costs are not tax-deductible for individuals in the UK. However, if your employer is paying for your retakes as part of professional development, they may be able to claim the cost as a business expense.

### Can I get a refund if I decide not to sit the exam?

Refund policies vary. Most exam centres offer a partial refund if you withdraw before the entry deadline, minus an administration fee of £30 to £50. After the deadline, refunds are rarely available. Check your centre's terms before committing.

### Is it worth paying for a retake college?

For students who need to improve by two or more grades, a specialist retake college provides the structure, expertise, and accountability that significantly increases the chances of success. [80% of students at retake colleges achieve A* to B](/a-level-retakes/), and [77% secure places at Russell Group universities](/a-level-retakes/). If the cost is within reach, the investment often pays for itself through better university outcomes and career prospects.

### Do universities care how much I spent on retaking?

No. Universities see your grades, not your preparation method. A student who achieved an A through self-study is viewed identically to one who attended a premium retake college. What matters is the grade on your certificate.

## Next Steps

The cost of retaking A-Levels varies enormously depending on your situation, but every route is achievable with the right planning. Start by understanding which costs are unavoidable (exam board and centre fees) and then decide how much support you need to reach your target grade.

If you are unsure which route offers the best value for your situation, [make an enquiry](/enquiry/) to speak with a specialist advisor who can help you weigh up your options.
