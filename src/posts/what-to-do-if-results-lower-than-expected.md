Opening your A-Level results to find they're not what you expected is one of the most stressful experiences for students. But before you panic, remember that you have options. This guide will help you navigate this challenging situation and find the best path forward.

## First Things First: Don't Panic

Take a deep breath. Disappointing results feel devastating in the moment, but they don't define your future. Thousands of students face this situation every year and go on to achieve their goals through various routes.

## Immediate Steps to Take

### 1. Check Your Results Carefully

Make sure you understand exactly what grades you received:
- Were they what you were predicted?
- Were any results surprisingly low or high?
- Are there any errors in the paperwork?

### 2. Contact Your School or College

Your teachers and school administrators are there to help. They can:
- Explain your options
- Help you understand if a remark might be worthwhile
- Provide references and support
- Advise on next steps

### 3. Contact Your University (If Applicable)

If you were holding a university offer, contact admissions immediately:
- They may still accept you with lower grades
- They might offer you an alternative course
- They can explain [Clearing](/resources/ucas-clearing-guide/) options
- They'll tell you definitively where you stand

## Your Options Explained

### Option 1: Request a Remark or Appeal

If you believe your grade is wrong, you can request a remark:

**Priority remarking** (available from results day):
- Results usually within 18 days
- Useful if you need confirmation for university
- Higher fee but faster turnaround

**Standard remarking** (available after priority deadline):
- Results within 20 days
- Lower fee
- Grades can go up, down, or stay the same

**When to consider a remark:**
- Your grade was significantly lower than expected
- You were just a few marks off the higher grade boundary
- Your teacher believes there may have been a marking error

### Option 2: Accept a Different University Place

If your first-choice university won't accept you:
- Check if they offer an alternative course
- Look at similar courses at other universities through [Clearing](/resources/ucas-clearing-guide/)
- Consider foundation years that lead to your desired degree

### Option 3: Take a Gap Year and Reapply

A gap year can be valuable for:
- Gaining work experience
- Travelling and personal development
- Reapplying with your actual grades (often stronger than predicted)
- Taking time to consider your options carefully

### Option 4: Retake Your A-Levels

[Retaking A-Levels](/a-level-retakes/) is a common and respectable choice that can help you:
- Achieve the grades you need for your preferred university
- Improve your understanding of subjects
- Demonstrate determination and resilience
- Keep your original career goals on track

Most students who retake with proper support improve by at least one grade per subject.

### Option 5: Consider Alternative Qualifications

Other routes into higher education include:
- Access to Higher Education courses
- BTEC qualifications
- Foundation degrees
- Higher National Diplomas (HNDs)

### Option 6: Explore Apprenticeships

Higher and degree apprenticeships offer:
- Earning while learning
- Real work experience
- A qualification at the end
- Often no student debt

Many top companies offer competitive apprenticeship programmes in fields from engineering to law.

## Making the Right Decision

When deciding what to do, consider:

### Your Career Goals
- Does your chosen career require specific qualifications?
- Are there alternative routes to that career?
- Will employers care about your A-Level grades in the long term?

### Your Circumstances
- Can you afford to take another year?
- Do you have support from family?
- Is your mental health affected by results pressure?

### Your Abilities
- Were your results a true reflection of your ability?
- Did external factors affect your performance?
- With better preparation, could you improve significantly?

## The Retake Route: What to Expect

If you decide [retaking](/a-level-retakes/) is right for you, here's what to know:

### Timing Options
- **November resits**: Some subjects offer November exam sessions
- **Summer resits**: Full exam series the following summer
- **Combination**: Spread subjects across both sessions

### Study Options
- Full-time at a sixth form or college
- [Private tuition](/private-tuition/) for personalised support
- Independent study with tutor support
- Online learning programmes

### What Universities Think
Contrary to some fears, universities generally view retake students positively:
- It shows determination and commitment
- Many successful students have retaken exams
- Your final grades matter more than how many attempts it took

## Success Stories

Remember that many successful people didn't get their expected grades first time:

- Retaking and achieving higher grades is common among medical and law students
- Many Russell Group students needed multiple attempts
- Employers rarely ask about A-Level grades once you have a degree

## What Not to Do

Avoid these common mistakes:

**Don't make hasty decisions** - Take time to consider all options

**Don't compare yourself to others** - Everyone's journey is different

**Don't believe it's the end** - There are always alternative paths

**Don't hide from the situation** - Face it, seek help, and make a plan
