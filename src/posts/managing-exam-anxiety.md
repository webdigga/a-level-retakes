Feeling anxious before exams is completely normal - in fact, a small amount of stress can actually improve performance. However, when anxiety becomes overwhelming, it can interfere with your ability to think clearly and demonstrate what you know. Here's how to manage exam anxiety effectively.

## Understanding Exam Anxiety

Exam anxiety is a type of performance anxiety that can manifest in various ways:

**Physical symptoms:**
- Racing heart
- Sweaty palms
- Feeling sick
- Difficulty sleeping
- Headaches

**Mental symptoms:**
- Racing thoughts
- Mind going blank
- Difficulty concentrating
- Negative self-talk
- Feeling overwhelmed

Recognising these symptoms is the first step to managing them effectively.

## Before the Exam: Preparation Strategies

### Create a Realistic Revision Plan

Poor preparation often fuels anxiety. A structured revision plan helps you feel in control:

- Break revision into manageable chunks
- Set realistic daily goals
- Include rest days and breaks
- Track your progress to build confidence

Check out our guide on [proven revision techniques](/resources/10-proven-revision-techniques/) for more study strategies.

### Practice Under Exam Conditions

Familiarity reduces anxiety. Practice past papers under timed conditions to:

- Get used to the time pressure
- Identify which topics need more work
- Build confidence in your abilities
- Develop effective exam strategies

### Look After Your Physical Health

Your body and mind are connected. In the weeks before exams:

- Maintain a regular sleep schedule (aim for 8-9 hours)
- Eat regular, nutritious meals
- Exercise regularly - even a 20-minute walk helps
- Limit caffeine, especially in the afternoon
- Stay hydrated

### Prepare the Night Before

Reduce last-minute stress by preparing everything the night before:

- Pack your bag with everything you need
- Lay out your clothes
- Check your exam timetable
- Set multiple alarms
- Avoid late-night cramming - rest is more valuable

## On Exam Day: Staying Calm

### Morning Routine

Start your day calmly:

- Wake up with plenty of time
- Eat a balanced breakfast
- Do some light stretching or exercise
- Avoid last-minute revision of new material
- Leave home early to avoid rushing

### Breathing Techniques

When anxiety hits, your breathing often becomes shallow. Try this technique:

**4-7-8 Breathing:**
1. Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold your breath for 7 seconds
3. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 3-4 times

This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, helping you feel calmer.

### Grounding Exercises

If you feel panic rising, try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique:

- **5** things you can see
- **4** things you can touch
- **3** things you can hear
- **2** things you can smell
- **1** thing you can taste

This brings your focus back to the present moment.

### Positive Self-Talk

Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I'm going to fail" | "I've prepared well and will do my best" |
| "I don't know anything" | "I know more than I think I do" |
| "Everyone else is smarter" | "I'm capable and well-prepared" |
| "This is impossible" | "I'll take it one question at a time" |

## During the Exam

### Read Instructions Carefully

Take time to read the paper thoroughly before starting. This helps you:

- Understand exactly what's being asked
- Plan your time effectively
- Identify questions you feel confident about

### Start with What You Know

Beginning with easier questions:

- Builds confidence
- Gets your brain working
- Ensures you don't miss marks on questions you know

### If Your Mind Goes Blank

Don't panic - this happens to everyone. Try:

- Taking three deep breaths
- Moving to a different question temporarily
- Writing down anything related to the topic
- Reading the question again slowly

### Manage Your Time

Keep an eye on the clock:

- Allocate time to each question based on marks available
- Leave time at the end for checking
- Don't spend too long on any single question
- Move on if you're stuck

## After the Exam

### Don't Post-Mortem

Avoid discussing answers with friends immediately after - it often increases anxiety about the next exam. Instead:

- Take a proper break
- Do something enjoyable
- Focus on the next exam, not the last one

### Celebrate Small Wins

Acknowledge your effort regardless of how you think it went:

- You showed up and tried your best
- Each exam is valuable experience
- One exam doesn't define your future

## When to Seek Help

If anxiety is significantly affecting your daily life or exam performance, consider:

- Speaking to your school counsellor
- Visiting your GP
- Contacting organisations like Mind or Anxiety UK
- Speaking to teachers about possible adjustments

## Remember: It's Not the End

Even if exams don't go as planned, there are always options:

- [Retaking A-Levels](/a-level-retakes/) is a perfectly valid path
- [UCAS Clearing](/resources/ucas-clearing-guide/) offers university opportunities
- Many successful people didn't get the grades they expected first time

Your worth is not determined by exam results. These are just one stepping stone on your journey.
